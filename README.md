## 🚀 About Me

I design and build production-ready web systems with a strong emphasis on backend architecture, security, and scalability.

My focus is not just building interfaces — but engineering reliable systems:

- Stateless authentication (JWT)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure webhook-based payment verification
- MongoDB indexing strategy for performance
- Serverless backend architecture

I enjoy thinking in terms of system design, data integrity, and production-grade engineering.
